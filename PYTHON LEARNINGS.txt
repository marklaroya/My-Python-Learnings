MY PYTHON LEARNINGS
BASICS:
1.)Script Mode Programming

using on the python interpreter
$ python3 test.py
	|		|
	v       V
 version .pyfile


another Example:
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Hello, World!")

 #!/usr/bin/python3:
 This is the shebang line. It tells the operating system to use the Python 3 interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3 to execute the script.


2. Python Identifiers
An identifier is the name used for variables, functions, classes, etc.

Class names start with uppercase letters.

Other names usually start with lowercase.

Example:

_name → private

__name → strongly private

__name__ → special name (like __init__)


3.)Python Lines and Indentation

Python uses lines to run code step by step and 
Python uses indentation instead of braces ({}) to group code blocks.

Example
if 5 > 2:
    print("Yes")  # indented: part of if block
    print("Still yes")
print("Done")     # not indented: outside the if

if True:
   print ("Answer")
   print ("True")
else:
   print ("Answer")
   print ("False")

4.)Python Multi-Line Statements

Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue

Example
total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item

Also Statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character.

Example:
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
        'Thursday', 'Friday']

5.)Quotations in Python

Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string

Example:
word = 'word'
print (word)

sentence = "This is a sentence."
print (sentence)

paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
 made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
print (paragraph)

6.)Comments in Python

A comment is a note you write in your code to explain what it does. Python ignores comments when running the program

Example:
# This is a comment
print("Hello")  # This prints Hello

Python doesn’t have true multi-line comment syntax, but you can use # on multiple lines:
# This is a comment
# that spans multiple lines
# explaining something

Using triple quotes
"""
This looks like a multi-line comment,
but it's actually a multi-line string
that’s not assigned to anything.
Python ignores it too.
"""

7.)Multiple Statements on a Single Line

The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line given that neither statement starts a new code block.

Example:
import sys; x = 'foo'; sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
